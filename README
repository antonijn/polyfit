	Method

Given 𝑛 points (𝑥ᵢ, 𝑦ᵢ) ∈ 𝐑², for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛, with the only
requirement that 𝑥ᵢ = 𝑥ⱼ implies 𝑖 = 𝑗, there exists a unique
polynomial 𝑃 of degree strictly smaller than 𝑛 such that
𝑃(𝑥ᵢ) = 𝑦ᵢ for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛.

This polynomial can be found using linear algebra. Write
𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑎₀ + 𝑎₁ 𝑥 + ⋯ + 𝑎ₙ₋₁ 𝑥ⁿ⁻¹. The requirement 𝑃(𝑥ᵢ) = 𝑦ᵢ
is now a system of linear equations:

  𝑎₀ + 𝑎₁ 𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝑎ₙ₋₁ 𝑥₁ⁿ⁻¹ = 𝑦₁
  𝑎₀ + 𝑎₁ 𝑥₂ + ⋯ + 𝑎ₙ₋₁ 𝑥₂ⁿ⁻¹ = 𝑦₂
               ⋮
  𝑎₀ + 𝑎₁ 𝑥ₙ + ⋯ + 𝑎ₙ₋₁ 𝑥ₙⁿ⁻¹ = 𝑦ₙ

If we define 𝒙ᵏ, 𝒚 ∈ 𝐑ⁿ by 𝒙ᵏ = (𝑥ᵢᵏ,…,𝑥ₙᵏ)ᵀ, and
𝒚 = (𝑦ᵢ,…,𝑦ₙ)ᵀ, then this system reduces to:

  𝑎₀ 𝒙⁰ + ⋯ + 𝑎ₙ₋₁ 𝒙ⁿ⁻¹ = 𝒚

Define now an 𝑛 by 𝑛 matrix 𝑿 by 𝑿ᵢ₊₁ = 𝒙ⁱ, and 𝒂 ∈ 𝐑ⁿ by
𝒂 = (𝑎₀,…,𝑎ₙ₋₁)ᵀ, then the system collapses to:

  𝑿 𝒂 = 𝒚

Because 𝑥ᵢ ≠ 𝑥ⱼ for 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗, the matrix 𝑿 is invertible.
Then 𝒂 = 𝑿⁻¹𝒚, yielding values for the coefficients of 𝑃.
